Put so much thoughts, time and effort into this. so thought about having a documentation page for myself while also kinda making a tutorial about this portfolio/blog/digital garden website.

## Some inspirations

### But above all was this website which made me want one for myself

I chose vitepress intentionally as at that time I didn't want to use Docusaurus. I got along well with the vibe of vitepress and it was hacky enough for me to make something that I wanted.
