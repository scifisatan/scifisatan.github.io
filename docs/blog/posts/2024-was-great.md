At first, I wanted to write a long post appreciating the year 2024, but 2025 happened so fast and so soon, I didn't get time to reflect.

But here it is, I'll just give quick recap to things that made this year great.

This year was the year of opportunity, most of which I took and gave my best and rest were a slight bummmer ig.

- I got rejected for LSPP.
- I got rejected for Annual AI School by NAAMI (not technically but i didn't get to attend)
- I got rejected for Github Campus Expert
- there are others too but i think these were the big 3 lol

Before this, I was just an engineering student who goes to college daily, sits in classes and stuff.

This changed when I accepted the role of Campus Director for Hult Prize at our college. This responsibility made me learn, grow and adapt. I am quite proud of what me and my team achieved in our tenure.

After that, I got to attend Hult Prize Regionals at Mumbai and I am very grateful to my College Administration and Hult Prize for this opportunity.

I went to my first hackathon which is Hackademia 2.0
This event was the one which gave me so much inspirations and motivations for my own events.

Lastly, I got to fulfill one of my goals which is to organise a hackathon in my college. It was Hack The Circle: Khwopa 2024.

Check it out here: [hackthecircle.khec.edu.np](https://hackthecircle.khec.edu.np/)

I would say this was the most challenging thing I've ever done as I was leading 20+ people to achieve a, double quote intended, "Intra-College Coding Competition". Collaborating with college administration, teachers, fellow organising members and the participants, the end of it was VERYYYYYYY worth it.

Other than that, I got to contribute to AR Treasure Hunt, one of my favorite events. https://arth24.tech/
It was fun hanging out with KU peps. IMO Bibhushan is one of the creative people that i know and his standards for his works are high. I'm glad that i got to work along him.

I got to attend GITHUB FIELD DAY 2024 as well. coolest event hosted by coolest people fr.

I like human psychology I guess. Cause the experience I get to provide for everyone involved rather it be participants, organisers, teachers, it's very fulfilling.

At the core of being a human, we are shaped through our experience and hearing that some of the key moments of other's life, maybe even for a month, or a week, or a day, was something that I got to craft, soothes my heart.

And lastly, I don't think I would've been able to do any of it without the support of my college, for which I will be forever grateful.

And as the year ended, plans for next year was already in place lol. After that in January, 2025, I won AI Track in Semicolon (Hackathon) and I organised LOCUS Cubing Nepal 2025. Fun events.
