## Summary

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student at Khwopa College of Engineering. My keen interest in problem solving led me to try coding 7 years ago, which gave me experience in Python, C, C++, and Javascript.

**Fun Fact:** I can solve [Rubik's Cube](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019SHRE02) under 15 seconds.
